This Weather App is a straightforward application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows users to search for and view current weather information for any city. 
The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. The core files include index.
html for structure, main.css for styling, and main.js for handling API interactions and dynamic updates.
To get started, clone the repository, open index.html in a web browser, and replace the 
placeholder API key in script.js with your own key. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!
